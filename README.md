# Pong Game

A fast-food inspired pong game using javascript to create SVGs. Using Object Oriented Programming, I used classes, with methods and webpack to run this game. 

- The more you hit the ball the faster the ball will move on the x axis.
- Your goal is to score 10 points to win. 
- The green lettuce balls will appear in the game and you need to avoid them as they will decrease the size of your fries paddle. 
- Enjoy!!
